# The Optimal Course Selector Tool 🛠️
💰 This program uses a **greedy algorithm** to find the most optimal set of courses that can be taken at university. It's selection is based on the provided prerequisites that are given, as well as the classes the user would like to take in the future.

🤔 This program was made to aid in students' struggle to plan ahead for future university classes. The plethora of prerequisistes create quite the headache when trying to get in to a course.

💾 A small-scale example is provided below as to explain the function and output of the program. See below how MATH101 and MATH103 are not actually needed despite being a prerequisite for most courses.
